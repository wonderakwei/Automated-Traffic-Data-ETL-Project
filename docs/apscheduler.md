# `scheduler.py` README

## Overview

The `scheduler.py` script in the `scripts` folder is designed to automate tasks using the `APScheduler` library in Python. It enables the scheduling and execution of specific Python scripts at predefined intervals.

## Dependencies

The script depends on the following libraries:

- **APScheduler (version 3.8.1):**
  - A powerful library for scheduling tasks in Python.

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

- The scheduler is implemented using `apscheduler.schedulers.blocking.BlockingScheduler` with the UTC timezone.
- Tasks are defined in the `tasks` list, containing the command to execute.
- Logging is configured to capture information about task execution.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `scripts` folder in your terminal.

2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python scheduler.py
   ```

3. The scheduler will start and execute the defined tasks at the specified intervals.

## Task Definition

- Tasks are defined in the `tasks` list, each containing the command to execute.
- Adjust the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` parameters in the `scheduler.add_job` method to set the desired schedule.

## Logging

- Logging is configured to provide detailed information about task execution.
- Log messages include timestamps, log levels, and task-related details.

## Stopping the Scheduler

- The scheduler can be stopped at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C` or using an appropriate method based on your environment.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Python environment has the necessary permissions for executing tasks.
- Adjust task schedules and logging configurations as needed for your specific project.

This README offers a concise overview of the `scheduler.py` script's purpose, dependencies, configuration, usage, and additional considerations.
